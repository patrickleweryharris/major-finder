## Background  
UofT offers no easy tool to see what subject programs a student can study given their first year courses. Major finder was created to fill this gap

## Usage  
Major finder for UofT St. George and Mississauga campus is currently released [here](https://plh.io/major-finder). Major finder for UTSC is in development.

## API

Should you wish to develop major finder for another campus/school, all you need do is create a json file for that school,
then add this code into the find_majors() function in [major-finder.js](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/blob/master/js/major-finder.js):
```javascript
if (campusSelection == 'yourCampus'){
  jsonStr = 'yourJSONURL';
}
```
A corresponding selector must be added to the accompanying [html file](https://github.com/patrickleweryharris/major-finder/blob/master/test.html):
```html
<input type="radio" name="group1" id="r1" value="yourCampus">
        <label for="item1">Your Campus Name</label>
```

#### JSON Format

JSON files that utilize the application should be in the following format:  
```json
[
  {
    "name":"Computer Science Major / Specialist / Minor",
    "calLink":"http://calendar.artsci.utoronto.ca/crs_csc.htm#ASSPE1689",
    "requirements:":[
      "CSC148",
      "CSC165",
      "MAT135",
      "MAT136"
    ]
  }
]
```
## Notes

#### To Do
  - Filtering (i.e. if a user did not take any math courses there is no point searching through programs that require math)
  - Better feedback for user
  - Add UTSC version
  - Eventual updating to 2017 - 2018 calendar will be required

- Geoscience Major/Minor (40 different combinations)
- Earth and Environmental Systems Major (35 different combinations)
- Physical and Environmental Geography Specialist/Major/Minor

- Renaissance Studies Specialist / Major / Minor (pick from a list of courses)
