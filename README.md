## Background  
UofT offers no easy tool to see what subject programs a student can study given their first year courses. Major finder was created to fill this gap

## Usage  
Major finder for UofT St. George is currently released (the gh-pages branch is the release branch). Major finder for UTM is currently in development (master branch).

Should you wish to develop major finder for another campus/school, all you need do is create a json file for that school, then put this into the find_majors() function:
```javascript
if (campusSelection == 'yourCampus'){
  jsonStr = 'yourJSONURL';
}
```
A corresponding selector must be added to the accompanying html file.

### JSON Format

JSON files that utilize the application should be in the following format:  
```json
[
  {
    "name":"Computer Science Major / Specialist / Minor",
    "calLink":"http://calendar.artsci.utoronto.ca/crs_csc.htm#ASSPE1689",
    "requirements:":[
      "CSC148",
      "CSC165",
      "MAT135",
      "MAT136"
    ]
  }
]
```

## To Do
  - Filtering (i.e. if a user did not take any math courses there is no point searching through programs that require math)
